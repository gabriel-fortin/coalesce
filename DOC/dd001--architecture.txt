design decisions -- 001: overall architecture

An architecture enforcing encapsulation and separation of concerns is needed.

The app will be divided in a few modules which will enforce that dependencies
 are going only to lower layers. Modules:
     - entity -- only POJOs defining the model
     - use case -- defines the repository interface and actions on the model
     - presenter -- defines interactions with the user (in a UI agnostic way), views' interfaces
     - app -- views, repository, networking, DI, persistence
