# Coalesce
App for people sharing some aspect of their life.

User oriented goals:
* provide shared shopping lists
* chat (possibly extended by lists' events)
   + allow silent messages (which doesn't trigger sound notifications)
* minimal navigation needed to use main functionality

Dev goals:
* apply good architecture (keywords: clean architecture, MVP, VIPER)
* use Kotlin
* use RxJava 2
* use Dagger 2 (including scopes, if possible)
* maintain a good log of requirements and decisions
* _maybe provide websocket communication for chat_

This is a project I'm doing for private benefit and self-improvement. It's meant to overcome disadvantages of the "Couple" app.
